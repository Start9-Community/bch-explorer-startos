# AGENTS.md

This is a StartOS service-package repository — it builds a `.s9pk` for StartOS.

Develop it inside a StartOS packaging workspace created by `start-cli s9pk init-workspace`,
which provides the packaging guide and agent context one level up. If you're reading this in a
bare clone with no workspace, the full guide is at <https://docs.start9.com/packaging>.

Work this package's `TODO.md` from top to bottom. Keep `README.md` (technical reference for an AI support or administering agent) and `instructions.md` (end-user docs) in sync with your changes.

## This repo

- **The frontend and backend images are prebuilt upstream and cannot be rebuilt here**, and are published for x86_64 only — aarch64 runs them under emulation via `emulateMissingAs`.
- **The chain follows the node, and is never configured here.** `main.ts` reads the selected node's own `store.json` off its read-only `/mnt/node` mount for the chain and — on BCHN and BCHD — the RPC credentials. `explorerNetwork()` in `startos/utils.ts` maps the node's spelling (`testnet3`) onto the frontend's (`testnet`); regtest maps to nothing and fails the service deliberately. The chain drives the `db` volume subpath, `EXPLORER_NETWORK`, and the frontend's `*_ENABLED` toggles, so a chain change must restart `main`.
- **Dependencies are reached over the LXC bridge, never `.startos` DNS.** `startos/utils.ts` resolves each node's RPC and Fulcrum BCH's Electrum port through `sdk.host.getBridgeAddress(...).const()`. BCHN's RPC port moves per chain, so that `.const()` is also the chain-change signal for it; BCHD and Flowee pin one port for every chain, so the api daemon's health check re-reads the node's `store.json` and restarts on drift. BCHD must be dialed through its **plaintext proxy** binding (`rpc-plaintext`, 8334) — the explorer backend cannot speak TLS to `CORE_RPC`.
- **BCHN is the one dependency whose host id is a literal.** BCHD, Flowee and Fulcrum BCH all export their host ids and ports, and `startos/utils.ts` imports them; `bitcoin-cash-node-startos/startos/utils` exports `networkPorts` and the _interface_ ids but no `rpcHostId`, so `'rpc'` is spelled out there. Exporting it upstream would remove the last literal.
- **The api daemon's `ready` doubles as the chain-change detector.** BCHD and Flowee pin one RPC port on every chain, so the bridge address gives no signal, and the node's chain lives in a file rather than a reactive source — so each healthy poll re-reads it and restarts on drift. On BCHN the port does move per chain, so its `.const()` catches it too.
- **`main` throws only for a chain the explorer cannot render** (regtest). An unreachable node or indexer is a warning and an unset env var, not a failure — the `.const()` heals it.
- **The backend's `start.sh` refuses to run while its PID file exists**, so the daemon command removes a stale one and kills whatever still holds the API port before exec'ing. Without it, one crash wedges every subsequent restart.
- **`repair-mariadb` exists because a StartOS rebuild does not remove `tc.log`.** MariaDB crash-loops on a bad magic header in that file after an unclean shutdown or a full disk; the action deletes only that file and keeps the indexed data.
